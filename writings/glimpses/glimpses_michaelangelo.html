<p>Michelangelo had a temper of the quickest. He used to quarrel and fight in season and out of season. A young sculptor named Torrignano was terribly jealous of Michelangelo&#39;s ability. On his part there was jealousy, and on Michelangelo&#39;s part there was anger, So jealousy and anger fought together. In the fight Torrignano struck Michelangelo mercilessly and broke his nose. Michelangelo&#39;s nose remained disfigured for the rest of his life. As a result, Torrignano was compelled to leave the city.</p>
<h4>The Overnight Trickster</h4>
<p>Michelangelo loved to glorify the human body in its pristine form --that means, as natural as possible. He was wont to dress his figures with clothes as little as possible. He was ruthlessly assailed by certain moralists for his Last Judgement. A Vatican official felt that this particular painting was another name for a shocking and unspeakable experience. In order to console the poor official, the immortal Michelangelo made a few changes. He added a donkey&#39;s ears and a snake&#39;s tail! The immortal artist proved to be an overnight trickster.</p>
<h4>Michelangelo and the Pope</h4>
<p>Michelangelo and Pope Julius were always in the habit of quarreling. The artist would always find it impossible to comply with the Pope&#39;s request or command. Once the Pope asked Michelangelo to paint gold onto some figures. Michelangelo said, &quot;It cannot be. Holy men cannot wear gold.&quot; The Pope said, &quot;Why not? They can!&quot; The artist would not listen, but this time Pope Julius did not want to fight. He was sick of fighting with Michelangelo for he knew that the artist had a temper of the quickest, the worst possible temper. So he forgave Michelangelo&#39;s outbursts and rewarded him for his extraordinary capacities as an artist. Here the Pope valued the art, ignoring the shortcomings of the artist.</p>
<h4>Fondness and Oneness Go Together</h4>
<p>Michelangelo was usually averse to leaving his name on his sculpture. But in the case of his beloved Pieta, he compelled the artist in him to sign the work. Once, a large number of strangers from Lombardi came to see his Pieta. They were all appreciation; they were wonderstruck. One of them wanted to know who the sculptor was. The immediate answer came from another in the gathering: &quot;Who else could achieve this kind of miracle, if not our Gabo of Milan?&quot; Fortunately or unfortunately, Michelangelo happened to be on the scene. A most powerful sadness tortured his being and he cursed the ignorant world. So, one night, when no human being was visible around his beloved Pieta, he cheerfully and proudly carved his name on the work. He felt that his fondness for his immortal sculpture and his immortal oneness with it must needs go together.</p>
<h4>An Unusual Justice-Light</h4>
<p>An art-lover named Agnolo commissioned Michelangelo to do a special painting. The payment was to be seventy ducats. When Michelangelo completed the painting, he felt that it was a tremendous success and he sent it to Agnolo&#39;s house by a messenger. Agnolo saw the painting and was greatly delighted. But all of a sudden, an unthinkable deception captured his mind. He gave the messenger forty ducats, instead of seventy, to give to Michelangelo. When the messenger returned and gave Michelangelo the forty ducats, the artist became furious. He gave the money back to the messenger to return it to Agnolo with a note: &quot;I cannot put up with a despicable liar like you. I am demanding more money than was in our agreement, since you have not kept your promise. Therefore, you must give me thirty extra ducats.&quot; This time the messenger came back from Agnolo with seventy ducats, which was what the first agreement mentioned. Michelangelo&#39;s anger reached its zenith. He said, &quot;Agnolo, since you are not a man of principle, I shall have to deal with you in an unthinkable way. You must send me one hundred forty ducats, double the amount on which we first agreed. For the liar, there is only one kind of medicine: an unusual justice-light!&quot;</p>
